# vehicle_creation

This package includes three main components, the availability publisher, priority publisher and the vehicle creation node which create a vehicle object which publishes and subscribes to the topics of each vehicle.
The availability publisher publishes the vehicle's availability onto the MQTT broker while the priority publisher publishes the vehicle's priority.
